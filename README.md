# IMF Tracker

In Mission: Impossible - Fallout, August Walker (Henry Cavill) uses a hand-held device to track
a John Lark decoy (Liang Yang) into a night club bathroom.  I thought the display was cool, so
I created my own.

In my version, you tap on the screen to create the target.  As you move around, the target tracks
your movements.
