# IMF Tracker

In Mission: Impossible - Fallout, August Walker (Henry Cavill) uses a hand-held device to track
a John Lark decoy (Liang Yang) into a night club bathroom.  I thought the display was cool, so
I created my own.

In my version, you tap on the screen to create the target.  As you move around, the target tracks
your movements.  It works best outdoors, since it used GPS.
